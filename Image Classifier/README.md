### CNN HW


Some main issues I found so far :

when running `pip install tensorflow` py would install the latest version. The tutorial does not use this version.
I believe that after this new big release they reordered their function and so most of them are not accessible in the same way
and require more/less attributes. The tutorial does not specify which tensor flow version it uses so for now I specified the v1 version
since its the closest to what they're using.
