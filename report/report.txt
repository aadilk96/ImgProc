- When the structuring element fits the definition domain of the image the
  result of the operator is known for sure and there are no border effects.
    - The subset of the definition domain where the borders do not interact
      is nothing but the definition domain eroded by the SE
    - The effects of the image borders are handled by specifying 
      particular values outside the image plane
        - This is why tmax is used for erosion and 0 for dilations
        - By doing so we avoid shrinking the definition domain
          after each morphological operation
