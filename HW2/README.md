# TO-DO

### Create neighbour function - done
### Create pixel function

### I) Generate output for the inverse of the distance transform 'f1_dinv.txt' derived from a blob image

### II) Generate output for the circle image (f2.txt). For this image, explain the differences between the 4 and 8 connected neighborhood implementations. Hint: 8-connected should produce much less regions - why?

### III) Generate output for three further images of your choice that shows multiple objects each to be segmented. Before applying the watershed transform, you must derive a suitable segmentation function through a method of your choice. This could include, for example, morphological gradient computation based on erosions and/or dilations, noise removal (e.g. median filter) or smoothing (e.g. bilateral or binomial filter) of the image before and/or after gradient computation, etc.
