# Image Processing HW2 - Watershed Transform

## Introuction

Explain purpose and process.

## Structure

File structure and hierarchy goes here.

## TO-DO

* ~Create neighbour function~
* ~Create pixel function~
* ~Create test function~
* Generate results and tests
  * ~ Generate output for the inverse of the distance transform 'f1_dinv.txt' derived from a blob image ~
  * Generate output for the circle image (f2.txt). For this image, explain the differences between the 4 and 8 connected neighborhood implementations.
    * ~Generate output circle~
    * ~Explain difference in report~
  * Generate output for three further images of your choice that shows multiple objects each to be segmented. Before applying the watershed transform, you must derive a suitable segmentation function through a method of your choice. This could include, for example, morphological gradient computation based on erosions and/or dilations, noise removal (e.g. median filter) or smoothing (e.g. bilateral or binomial filter) of the image before and/or after gradient computation, etc.
